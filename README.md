# Language Loader
This mod allows users to create translations for Stacklands.  No software development skills required.

# First Pass Note
This first version of the mod does not support custom fonts.  
The game's default font has characters from non English languages, but there may be some characters missing.  
If there are characters that aren't displayed correctly, the new language may need to wait until the second version.

# Overview:
Here is a brief overview of what is involved.  

* Subscribe to this mod.
* Download and extract the language template.
* Use this mod to dump all of Stacklands' current translations to get the text and keys to translate.
* Edit Files: 
    * ``add-language-info.json`` contains the base info for the new language.
    * ``localization.tsv`` add translations. Same format as Stacklands' localization.tsv.
    * ``manifest.json`` (the standard mod description file).
* Upload to Steam
