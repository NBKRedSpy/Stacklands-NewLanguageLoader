# New Language Loader

This mod allows users to create translations of the game using only .json files and the standard localization.tsv file.

The languages can be an existing language such as Vietnamese, or a custom language.

# First Pass Note
This first version of the mod does not support custom fonts.  
The game's default font has characters from non English languages, but there may be some characters missing.  
If there are characters that aren't displayed correctly, the language may need to wait until the second version.

**todo** point to wiki tutorial about testing the font for special characters.

# Overview:
Here is a brief overview of what is involved.  It only requires a text editor.  No codeing is required.

The full tutorial is available here:  

The process of creating a new language involves the following:
* Subscribe to this mod.
* Create a new mod folder.
* Create an add-language-info.json which contains the base info for the new language.
* Create a localization.tsv file which contains the key and translated text data.  Same format as Stacklands' localization.tsv.
* Create a manifest.json (The standard mod file) with dependency to this mod.
