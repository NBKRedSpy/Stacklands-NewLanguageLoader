[h1]Language Loader[/h1]

This mod allows users to create translations for Stacklands.  No software development skills required.

[h1]First Pass Note[/h1]

This first version of the mod does not support custom fonts.
The game's default font has characters from non English languages, but there may be some characters missing.
If there are characters that aren't displayed correctly, the new language may need to wait until the second version.
